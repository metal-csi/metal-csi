# Roadmap

- Documentation
  - Pretty much everything right now
  - `README.md` should include enough info to get started
  - Potentially use mdbook or similar
- Rename everything referencing `zed-csi`
- Mount options
  - `-o` mount options
  - owner uid/gid
  - Anonymous naming (e.g. use the `pvc-` uuid)
- Additional backend types
  - Subdirectory
  - Things other than ZFS
- Snapshotter
  - Snapshot on "delete"
- Resizer
